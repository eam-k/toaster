# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react';

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
});
```

## Notes

I really enjoyed working on this exercise! It presented some interesting challenges around state management and animations that made it quite engaging to work through.

For the styling approach, I kept things fairly agnostic and similar to what was shown in the video example. I felt this would demonstrate the core functionality without getting too caught up in visual design details.

Of course, there are many additional considerations we could explore further, things like accessibility enhancements, more sophisticated animation sequences, error handling edge cases, and performance optimizations for handling large numbers of toasts. I made the decision to focus on implementing the essential component functionality first, as I believe this covers the main requirements effectively.

I'm documenting some of these additional ideas and technical decisions in my notes, which I'd be happy to discuss in more detail if we move forward in the process. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
